Examples of defects include, but are not limited to:

Suspicious Sender: The sender's email address is not from the official domain of the company, which is a sign that the email may not be legitimate.
Unusual Activity Claim: The email claims there has been "unusual activity" on the account, but does not provide any specific details about what the unusual activity was, which is suspicious.
Suspicious Link: The link provided in the email looks suspicious because it is not a direct link to the company's website, and instead uses a third-party domain that may not be trustworthy.
Urgency: The email creates a sense of urgency by threatening to suspend the account within 24 hours, which can pressure the user to act quickly without thinking critically about the email's authenticity.
Generic Salutation: The email does not address the user by name, which is a sign that it may be a phishing email. Phishing emails are often sent to a large number of people and do not contain personalized information.
