# GLAB-908.11.1-IncidentResponse

## Bash script for understanding incident response
This is a bash script that helps learners understand the concept of incident response. Incident response is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing security incidents to minimize the impact on an organization's operations and assets. This script reads incident data from a CSV file and displays an incident report for each line of data in the file. It also provides an introduction and explanation of incident response and concludes with a reminder of the importance of incident response for maintaining security and continuity.

## Getting started
To use this script, make sure you have a CSV file with incident data in the following format: incident_type,incident_priority,incident_severity,incident_status,incident_resolution. Then, run the following command:


```
bash incident_response.sh
```

The script will read the incident data from the CSV file and display an incident report for each line of data in the file.
