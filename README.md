# GLAB-908.11.1-IncidentResponse

## Bash script for understanding incident response
This is a bash script that helps learners understand the concept of incident response. Incident response is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing security incidents to minimize the impact on an organization's operations and assets. This script prompts the user to identify the type, priority, severity, status, and resolution of an incident, and then displays an incident report. It also provides an introduction and explanation of incident response and concludes with a reminder of the importance of incident response for maintaining security and continuity.

## Getting started
To use this script, simply run the following command:


```
bash incident_response.sh
```

The script will prompt you to identify the type, priority, severity, status, and resolution of an incident. After you provide this information, the script will display an incident report.
